StoryWeaver is an open source platform by Pratham Books for multilingual childrenâ€™s stories.
It addresses all the issues around the lack of content by using an open access framework and
technology as force multipliers combined with a platform that supports translation and 
re-mixing av stories.

## Project 1: SDK for StoryWeaver reader experience 
StoryWeaver progressive web app (PWA) has a content reader experience built which allows
easy consumption of stories (both online/offline) on the platform for children who are in
the stage of developing the conceptual model of associating words with their corresponding
visual representation. This project would aim to build a Software Development Kit (SDK)
which could allow porting this reader experience to mobile platforms (Android/iOS).

**Expected Impact**: The easy to use web reader experience availability via SDK would encourage
developers on mobile platforms to recreate the seamless reading experience on mobile.

**Deliverable**: SDK for reader experience with a dummy Android app using the SDK for the
currently available PWA reader experience


## Project 2: Predictive Multilingual search on StoryWeaver

StoryWeaver supports story consumption in ~280 languages including a lot of underserved
languages.  The aim of this project is to build a predictive search platform which supports
this large language scalability.

**Expected Impact**: A predictive search available in native underserved languages would
help users easily discover high quality content available on the platform.

**Deliverable**: A multilingual predictive search module using open-source tools like
ElasticSearch which can be integrated on the current StoryWeaver platform.
